# Task: 2

Write a function that implements a loan repayment calculator.

The loan repayment calculator should take the following input parameters:

Loan amount

Loan term (in months)

Interest rate (per year)

Repayment frequency (monthly, bi-monthly, or weekly)



The loan repayment calculator should output the following information:

Total interest to be paid over the loan term

Total amount to be repaid over the loan term

A table showing the breakdown of the loan repayments over the loan term, including the principal and interest amounts, and the remaining balance after each repayment.

Assume that the interest is calculated based on the outstanding balance of the loan, and that repayments are applied first to the interest and then to the principal.

Criteria for Evaluation:


Correctness: The output of the function should be correct and consistent with the input parameters.

Performance: The function should perform well for large inputs, taking into consideration time and 
space complexity.

Code quality: The code should be clean, readable, and well-organized. It should follow best practices for software development and include appropriate comments.


## Solution

Test coverage: The code should include appropriate test cases to demonstrate the correct behavior of the function.


You can use any programming language and framework that you feel comfortable with. The solution should be delivered along with the source code and a detailed README 

file that explains how to build and run the code, as well as any additional information that you consider relevant.

Please submit the code via a link to a public repository in a Git hosting platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
